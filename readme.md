your glitch link e.g. https://repimentel-a3-persistence-1.glitch.me/

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- recipe scraper that saves the past searches of each user
- modifying my code to use express
- mongodb and local authentication (never used a database like mongo so I wanted to try)
- Bootstrap (looks professional)
- passport, express, express-session, express-ejs-layouts, body-parser

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used bcryptjs to hash my passwords, so they are not in plain text in the database
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used a remote database (MongoDb)

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I used a selenium python script to test my login (it worked), I can attach if necessary
- **Design Achievement 2**: I have good accesibility in some of my pages
